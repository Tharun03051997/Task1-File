1.Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2

HTTP/1.1

(i) HTTP protocol was developed in 1989 as the common language that enables client and server machines’ interaction. Process steps are as enlisted:

(ii) The client (browser) has to send a request to the server using the method (GET/POST).
Server responds with the requested resource, for example – image, alongside the status of what it did to the client’s request.

HTTP/2

HTTP/2 was released at Google as the significant improvement of its predecessor. It was initially modeled after the SPDY protocol and went through significant changes to 
include features like multiplexing, header compression, and stream prioritization to minimize page load latency. After its release, Google announced that it would not provide support 
for SPDY in favor of HTTP/2.

The major feature that differentiates HTTP/2 from HTTP/1.1 is the binary framing layer. 
Unlike HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2 uses a binary framing layer. This layer encapsulates messages – converted to its binary equivalent – 
while making sure that its HTTP semantics (method details, header information, etc.) remain untamed. This feature of HTTP/2 enables gRPC to use lesser resources.

2.Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript.

Objects, in JavaScript, are the most important data type and form the building blocks for modern JavaScript. These objects are quite different from JavaScript’s primitive 
data types (Number, String, Boolean, null, undefined, and symbol) in the sense that these primitive data types all store a single value each (depending on their types).

syntax:

let object_name = {
    key_name : value,
    ...
}
